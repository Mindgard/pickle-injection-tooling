### PoC ➡️ Demo: Pickle injection

Some light tooling that can add arbitrary code to pickle files and then trick pytorch into running them

- `make venv`
- source the venv
- `make install-reqs`
- `make train-model`
- `make attack-demo`

If you are on a MacOS machine with Minecraft installed, this will open the launcher.
